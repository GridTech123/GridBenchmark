#WIP
Remember that this is a work in progress and there will be more advanced benchmarks soon. We will delete the demo when thats out.

#What makes this unique compared to other benchmarks
-Its always going to be free <br>
-You can make your own benchmarks (tutorial will be out soon)

#Game benchmarks
I am working on benchmarks for diffrent games, the look of them will be based on the game and if its a benchmark for a gridtech game it
it will use the code from it! It will even tell you if the game will run well on your PC!

#Notes
Remember to use the EXE to eleminate the chance of crashes on startup
